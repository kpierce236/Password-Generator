# Password Generator

## Description

In this project I added the functionailty with JavaScript to make the appilcation usable. I used my knowledge of basic JavaScript to finish the '''generatePassword()''' function. I created multiple variables, arrays, and objects for the data structuring, as well as functtions, methods, for loops, and conditional statements for the manipulating the data and adding functionality to the application.

### Take-Aways

- The problem my password generator solves for the end user is that they will now be able to create and use more secure password.

- I learned about functions, objects, for loops, condtional statements, variables, logical operators, arrays, and more from the basics of JavaScript.

## Usage

This appilcation is a web app that allows for users to generate random passwords according to a set of criteria.

- When you click the Generate Password button a prompt is presented in the browser asking for a password length within 8 - 128 characters.
    - If you do not input the right amount of characters an alert will appear stating that you need more characters.
- When you input a correct length then you are presented with a set of other prompts asking for criteria for the password.
    - If you do not select at least one criteria then you will  be presented with an error to add at least one.
- Once you select your password criteria a randomly generated password matching the length and criteria will be displayed on the webpage.
